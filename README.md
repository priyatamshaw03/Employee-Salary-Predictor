## Introduction
The **Employee Salary Predictor** is a Python-based machine learning app that estimates employee salaries from input features using a pre-trained model. It provides both a command-line interface and an interactive web interface via Streamlit.

## Features
- Train a regression model to predict salaries from features.
- Save and load trained model (`model.pkl`) and its feature metadata (`model_columns.pkl`).
- Streamlit-based UI (`app.py`) for real-time salary predictions.
- Easily test predictions using `test_predictions.pkl`.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Primary Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, Streamlit  
- **Serialization**: joblib/pickle  

## Repository Structure
├── .devcontainer/ # (Optional) Dev container config
├── Salary Data.csv # Dataset used for training
├── train_model.py # Script to train and serialize the model
├── model.pkl # Trained ML model
├── model_columns.pkl # Feature columns metadata
├── test_predictions.pkl # Serialized test predictions

## Dataset
- **Salary Data.csv**: Contains input features and corresponding salaries. *(If available, specify columns like "YearsExperience", "EducationLevel", etc.)*
- Please include source details—public dataset, custom, or otherwise—and any preprocessing steps here.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyatamshaw03/Employee-Salary-Predictor.git
   cd Employee-Salary-Predictor
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. To train the model (and update model.pkl):

```bash
python train_model.py
```

4. Launch the Streamlit UI:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Use the web interface to input features and obtain salary predictions.

# Model Training & Testing

train_model.py: Loads the dataset, trains a regression model, and saves the model + feature columns.

test_predictions.pkl: Includes sample test inputs and their predicted outputs for validation.

# Deployment (Streamlit)

app.py builds a clean GUI for users to interact with the predictor. Future improvements could include:

Model explainability (e.g., SHAP plots).

REST API support.

CI/CD pipeline setup.
